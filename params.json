{"name":"Appyrules","tagline":"AppyRules is a rule engine. It allows you to separate conditional logic from source code.","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuse AppyRules;\r\n\r\n$stack = new Stack();\r\n\r\n$stack->addVar('price');\r\n$stack->addStatic(180);\r\n$stack->addOperator('>');\r\n\r\n$stack->addVar('weight');\r\n$stack->addStatic(180);\r\n$stack->addOperator('>');\r\n\r\n$stack->addVar('price');\r\n$stack->addStatic(120);\r\n$stack->addOperator('>');\r\n\r\n$stack->addVar('price');\r\n$stack->addStatic(120);\r\n$stack->addOperator('>');\r\n\r\n$stack->addOperator('or');\r\n$stack->addOperator('and');\r\n\r\n\r\n$rule = new EngineRule();\r\n$result = $rule->execute($stack);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@jimmyy and @s\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
